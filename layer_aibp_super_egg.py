"""# Task
Analyze the egg price data from "Predict Egg Price 2022-25 with Date - Train_Pmhoo.csv" using the Prophet model with 'LayinghenPrice', 'FeedPrice', and 'Stock' as regressors to predict future prices. Then, use the model to predict prices on the test data from "Predict Egg Price 2022-25 with Date - Test_Pmhoo.csv". Finally, create visualizations for the 52-week forecast, predicted vs actual prices, and the yearly trend.

"""## Summary:

### Data Analysis Key Findings

*   The Prophet model was successfully initialized and fitted using 'Layingheny', 'Feedy', and 'Stock' as regressors and 'yMarket' (renamed to 'y') as the target variable from the training data.
*   A future dataframe for a 52-week forecast was created. Regressor values for 'Layingheny', 'Feedy', and 'Stock' in the future dataframe were populated using the mean values from the training data.
*   The test data was successfully prepared for prediction by renaming the date column to 'ds', the price column ('PriceMarket') to 'y', and the regressor columns ('LayinghenPrice', 'FeedPrice') to match the names used in the model ('Layingheny', 'Feedy').
*   Predictions were successfully made on both the future dataframe and the prepared test data.
*   Three visualizations were successfully generated: the 52-week forecast plot, the plot comparing actual and predicted prices on the test data, and the yearly trend component plot.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   The visualizations provide a clear view of the model's performance and the projected future trend, indicating seasonality and the model's ability to capture the historical price movements on the test set.
*   Future work could involve exploring alternative methods for populating regressor values in the future dataframe (e.g., using forecasts for regressors themselves) to potentially improve long-term forecast accuracy.
